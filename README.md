# Emerging Technologies

A repository which contains the learning outcomes achieved throughout the duration of this module, within my final year of studying in Software Development.

All practical work done throughout this module will be done within a **JupyterLite** instance.

## Learning Outcomes

  - Explore new emerging technologies within computing by researching credible sources
  - Discuss an emerging technology and identify its origins and proponents
  -  Apply research on an emerging technology in order to use it and avail of its benefits
  - Provide and implement a solution to a computing problem using an emerging technology

## Notebooks

The following notebooks may be found within this repository, discussing the various topics I have researched and learned upon during the course of this module.

### HTTP
